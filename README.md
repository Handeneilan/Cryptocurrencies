# Cryptocurrencies

## The purpose the analysis

Our client asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for their new investment.

The data we worked with was not ideal, so it needed to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there was no known output for what we were looking for, we  decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
